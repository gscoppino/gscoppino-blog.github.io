Hello, everyone. My name is Giuseppe Scoppino, and I am a software developer residing in Marietta, GA. I'm currently in my third year of university at Kennesaw State, working towards a Bachelor's Degree in Software Engineering. I am employed by Georgia Tech Research Institute, working on collaborative systems engineering web applications. I'm also a hobbyist web developer, and currently working with a group of students at my university on a service that aims to streamline the process of buying, selling, and trading between students of college campuses.
